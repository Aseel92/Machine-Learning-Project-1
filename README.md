# Machine-Learning-Project-1
This project implements an end-to-end workflow for analyzing customer behavior using unsupervised learning techniques. 
It involves data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection based on correlation, and clustering using the DBSCAN algorithm. It prepares the clustered data for supervised classification by creating training and testing datasets. 
Visualizations and metrics are used throughout the process to ensure meaningful insights.
